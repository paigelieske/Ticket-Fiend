# Ticket-Fiend
A search site for various tickets 
What this web application does is find various tickets, whether they be for sporting events, concerts, plays, etc., being sold from various sources and puts them all in one location. This application utilizes an API called SeatGeek in order find the information on events throughout the United States and Canada for us to use in our application. The problem that this solves is that it condenses search results from 60+ ticket sites into one application, thus making finding the right ticket price much easier for a user to find. 

Some of the steps that we all took in creating this web application include:
1. Finding an API that would work properly and could be used to solve a viable problem.
2. Once we found the API that we used for this web application, we began devlopment on the actual application itself by dividing the tasks of creating the UI, the JavaScript, the AJAX call, and the CSS animations among ourselves. 
3. Then two of us started to go through the API documentation to see how to set up the URL that would be used to get the information needed for the application to work. Meanwhile, the other two members of the group started to work on the basic HTML and CSS for the basic UI for the application. 
4. After the majority of the UI was completed, we began the challanging process of trying to integrate the webpage with the functionality of the JavaScript so that the application will work, all the while trying to not interfere with the overall UI.
5. The last thing that we had to do before merging everything into the final branch was to do some minor compatability tweeks and to iron out any errors or incompatabilities that were present and to compile all of the CSS in Sass.
6. The final step, launch the final product as a static website through Github.

Some of the problems that we encountered include: trying to get the search parameters for the API to work properly so that they are not too specific or too general, trying to get the JavaScript to work properly with on click events triggered from the HTML, and the initial launch of the website did not work as intended. 

Some of the future addition that we would like to add to this application include functioning ride applications (i.e. Uber, Lyft, etc.) that work when clicked, adding reviews to various event, the use of GeoLocations, and recomendations based on search choices.
